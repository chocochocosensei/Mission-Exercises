                    <p>Today's class was my first, and I was a bit nervous. Lot's of new kids and parents to meet, names to learn and forget. One younger student was just getting comfortable with Code Combat. I'd never seen it in action before, so we had
                        to learn together how to go from one level to the next. In the end I think he made a lot of progress. I could see that he had learned how to make his character move and how to attack, and was starting to reuse what he had learned
                        at each new level. It was a bit challenging, but he made lots of progress.active</p>

                    <p>Lots of kids today as it was a combined class. This week I helped S. from last week review his work in Code Combat, and I helped Alan teach Mission 3/4 to two of the older girls. I spent some time helping everyone mastering their interfaces,
                        that is using the keyboard, mouse, and touchpad. It seems like a simple thing for us adults, but for kids it can still be quite challenging. We taught them some shortcuts for moving lines of text around the page that came in very
                        useful.
