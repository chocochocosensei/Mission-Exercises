        <p>Today's class was my first, and I was a bit nervous. Lot's of new kids and parents to meet, names to learn and forget. One younger student was just getting comfortable with Code Combat. I'd never seen it in action before, so we had to learn together
            how to go from one level to the next. In the end I think he made a lot of progress. I could see that he had learned how to make his character move and how to attack, and was starting to reuse what he had learned at each new level. It was a
            bit challenging, but he made lots of progress.active</p>
