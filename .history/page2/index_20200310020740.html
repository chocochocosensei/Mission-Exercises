        <p>Lots of kids today as it was a combined class. This week I helped S. from last week review his work in Code Combat, and I helped Alan teach Mission 3/4 to two of the younger girls. I spent some time helping everyone mastering their interfaces,
            that is using the keyboard, mouse, and touchpad. It seems like a simple thing for us adults, but for kids it can still be quite challenging. We taught them some shortcuts for moving lines of text around the page that came in very useful.</p>
